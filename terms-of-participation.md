# Terms of Participation

Participants in the platform agree to the following principles when earning Governance Tokens (GT) and Functional Tokens (FT):

## Eligibility and Conduct
- Only complete and verifiable tasks are eligible for token rewards.
- Participants must provide accurate information and respect community guidelines.
- Fraudulent activity or manipulation of task metrics results in forfeiture of rewards.

## Governance and Voting
- GT holders may submit and vote on proposals that shape platform policies and upgrades.
- Each staked GT contributes to voting power; unstaked GT does not grant governance rights.
- Votes are final once recorded on-chain and may carry staking penalties for malicious behavior.

## Staking Requirements
- Staking GT is required to access governance features and higher reward tiers.
- Staked tokens are subject to lockup periods defined by governance.
- Early withdrawal during lockup forfeits any pending rewards.

## Reward Distribution
- FT is distributed for successfully completed tasks validated by Proof of Observation.
- GT rewards are issued for long-term contributions such as staking and governance participation.
- Rewards may be adjusted or revoked for violations of these terms.

## AI Console Access
- Access to the AI console requires holding or staking a minimum amount of FT.
- Heavy usage of the console consumes FT credits; additional staking may be required for extended sessions.
- Abuse of the console, including attempts to bypass staking gates, may result in suspension of access.

By participating in the platform, users acknowledge that they have read and agree to these terms.
