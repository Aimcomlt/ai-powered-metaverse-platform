 Trust, But Verify: This Contract Ensures You Actually Did the Work

 📌 What Is This?

`ProofOfObservation` (PoO) is the **task verification gatekeeper** in the metaverse platform.

It’s the only contract that decides **if a user truly completed a task**, and only after approval does it:
- ✅ Tell `HouseOfTheLaw` to reward the user with **Governance Tokens (GTs)** and **Functional Tokens (FTs)**.

No shortcuts, no fake completions.  
**Only valid work gets rewarded.**

 🧠 Why Is This Important?

In Web3 learning or contribution platforms, people sometimes claim they did things — but didn’t.

PoO fixes that.

> It acts like a “teacher” who checks your work before you get your grade or your reward.

 🧩 How It Fits Into the Ecosystem

```

User → Submits Task → ProofOfObservation → (if valid) → HouseOfTheLaw → 🎖 GTs & 💰 FTs Minted

````

- **GTs** = Proof of your reputation and influence
- **FTs** = Usable tokens for tools, access, or trading


 🛠 How It Works (Simplified)

 Step 1: Submit a Task
A user uploads proof of their work (like a project, essay, or video link) by calling:
```solidity
submitTask(taskId, ipfsHash)
````

 Step 2: Task Gets Reviewed

A trusted validator (human or AI agent) reviews it and calls:

```solidity
validateTask(taskId, ftId, gtReward)
```

 Step 3: Tokens Are Minted

If approved:

* The PoO contract tells **HouseOfTheLaw** to issue your GT and FT rewards.
* Your task is marked “validated” forever on the blockchain.

 🔐 Who Has Permission to Approve?

Only wallets with the `VALIDATOR_ROLE` (trusted humans or agents) can approve tasks.

Admins can assign or revoke validator roles.

 🧾 Key Events

| Event           | What It Tracks                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `TaskSubmitted` | A user submitted task proof                        |
| `TaskValidated` | A validator approved it and rewards were triggered |

 🛡️ Security + Upgradeability

* Uses **role-based access control** (via OpenZeppelin).
* Upgradeable using the **UUPS proxy pattern**, so new features can be added safely over time.
* Prevents double validation or fake task entries.
